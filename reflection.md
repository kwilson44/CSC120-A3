For the project, I consulted with Erin Riley, Anna Boden, Kathleen Bacigalupi, and Joanna Li  :D. I went to TA on Sunday at 1, and I also went to office hours on Wednesday. Overall, I started on this project on Tuesday and had relatively high hopes that it wouldn't be too bad. While I found it less overwhelming than the first one (and more fun) it still required a lot of time, discussion, and hard work. This project opened my eyes to the beauty of discussing problems. I saw that the more I talked about my code and it's errors, the more clear the solutions became. I really liked this project but I'm worried my code is too much of a procedural and not object oriented enough. I wanted to go back and "objectify" it but with time and everything I was out of luck. Objects in java can confuse me sometimes. I have taken a class on Java but I feel as though my skills (especially with objects) make this class essential to me. If I were to compare Java to Python, I'd say Java is the more specific one but I kinda prefer it's layout and functionality. I'm rather happy with the results of my code . At first, I hated how the mirror responses look because they're in an array but I was able to fix it. As stated above, making the output an array didn't work. It's much more useful for storing the output. I liked this assignment :D
